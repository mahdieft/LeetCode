# Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences

Given a string `s`, determine if all characters have the same frequency.

For example, given `s = "abacbc"`, return `true`, because all characters appear twice. Given `s = "aaabb"`, return
`false`. `a` appears 3 times, `b` appears 2 times. `3 != 2`.
