# Count Number of Nice Sub-Arrays

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers
in them.

For example, given `nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, `k = 3`, the answer is 2. The subarrays with 3 odd numbers in them are
`[1, 1, 2, 1]` and `[10., 2, 1, 1]`.
