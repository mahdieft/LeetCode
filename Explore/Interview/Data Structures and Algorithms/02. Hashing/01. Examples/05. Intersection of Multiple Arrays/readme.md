# Intersection of Multiple Arrays

Given a 2D array `nums` that contains `n` arrays of distinct integers, return a sorted array containing all the numbers
that appear in all `n` arrays.

For example, given `nums = [[3,1,2,4,5],[1,2,3,4],[3,4,5,6]]`, return `[3, 4]`. 3 and 4 are the only numbers that are in
all arrays.
